# GraphBLAS BFS for Reaction Networks

This project implements a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm using GraphBLAS to find shortest paths in directed reaction networks. It’s designed to efficiently handle sparse graphs, such as those representing chemical reaction networks, with support for path reconstruction and optional visualization.

## Overview

- **File**: `script2.py`
- **Purpose**: Generate random reaction networks and compute shortest paths between specified nodes using GraphBLAS.
- **Dependencies**:
  - `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `networkx` (for visualization)
  - `graphblas` (version 2025.2.0 used in testing)
- **Key Features**:
  - Generates directed graphs with ensured connectivity via a chain
  - Performs BFS using GraphBLAS’s sparse matrix operations
  - Reconstructs shortest paths
  - Visualizes the smallest graph case as a PNG

## Initial Setup

The code was initially developed with an older GraphBLAS version but encountered issues when run with version 2025.2.0. Two versions are discussed here:
- **Original Code**: An earlier implementation using `semiring.lor_land` and index-based predecessor tracking.
- **Final Code**: The updated, working version using `gb.semiring.ss.min_secondi` and simplified predecessor assignment.

### Test Cases
The `main()` function tests the BFS across multiple graph sizes:
- 200 molecules, 100 reactions
- 100 molecules, 300 reactions (visualized)
- 500 molecules, 1500 reactions
- 1000 molecules, 5000 reactions
- 5000 molecules, 20000 reactions

## Problem Encountered

When running with GraphBLAS 2025.2.0, the final code fixed these issues from earlier iterations:
1. **Deprecation Warning**: `semiring.min_secondi` was deprecated in favor of `gb.semiring.ss.min_secondi`.
2. **AttributeError**: `VectorExpression` objects no longer had a `structure()` method.
3. **TypeError**: Python bitwise operators (`all_nodes & ~visited`) didn’t work with GraphBLAS vectors.

### Error Output (Initial Attempts)
```
GraphBLAS: Starting from 31, targeting 181
DeprecationWarning: `gb.semiring.min_secondi` is deprecated; use `gb.semiring.ss.min_secondi`
Traceback: AttributeError: 'VectorExpression' object has no attribute 'structure'
```
```
GraphBLAS: Starting from 31, targeting 181
Traceback: TypeError: Bad type for argument `left` in Vector.__rand__(...). Got: <class 'NoneType'>
```

## The Fix

The final working version updated the `bfs_shortest_path_graphblas` function to resolve these issues, differing significantly from the original code in how it computes the shortest path.

### Original Code (Shortest Path Logic)
```python
def bfs_shortest_path_graphblas(edges_df: pd.DataFrame, start_node: int, end_node: int, 
                              n_molecules: int, visualize: bool = False, save_path: str = None):
    A = Matrix.from_coo(edges_df['source'], edges_df['target'], [True] * len(edges_df), nrows=n_molecules, ncols=n_molecules, dtype=bool)
    A_indices = Matrix.from_coo(edges_df['source'], edges_df['target'], edges_df['source'], nrows=n_molecules, ncols=n_molecules, dtype=int)
    frontier = Vector.from_coo([start_node], [True], size=n_molecules, dtype=bool)
    visited = Vector.from_coo([start_node], [True], size=n_molecules, dtype=bool)
    predecessors = Vector(int, n_molecules)
    predecessors[:] = -1
    all_nodes = Vector.from_coo(range(n_molecules), [True] * n_molecules, size=n_molecules, dtype=bool)
    
    distance = 0
    found = False
    
    while frontier.nvals > 0 and not found:
        distance += 1
        temp = frontier.vxm(A, semiring.lor_land)
        next_frontier = Vector(bool, n_molecules)
        mask = Vector(bool, n_molecules)
        mask << all_nodes
        mask(visited) << False
        next_frontier(mask) << temp
        
        frontier_indices = Vector.from_coo(frontier.to_coo()[0], frontier.to_coo()[0], size=n_molecules, dtype=int)
        parents = Vector(int, n_molecules)
        parents(next_frontier) << frontier_indices.vxm(A_indices, semiring.min_first)
        predecessors(next_frontier & (predecessors == -1)) << parents
        
        if next_frontier[end_node].get(False):
            found = True
        frontier.clear()
        frontier << next_frontier
        visited |= next_frontier
```

### Final Code (Shortest Path Logic)
```python
def bfs_shortest_path_graphblas(edges_df: pd.DataFrame, start_node: int, end_node: int,
                              n_molecules: int, visualize: bool = False, save_path: str = None):
    A = Matrix.from_coo(edges_df['source'], edges_df['target'], [True] * len(edges_df), nrows=n_molecules, ncols=n_molecules, dtype=bool)
    frontier = Vector.from_coo([start_node], [True], size=n_molecules, dtype=bool)
    visited = Vector.from_coo([start_node], [True], size=n_molecules, dtype=bool)
    predecessors = Vector(int, n_molecules)
    predecessors[:] = -1
    all_nodes = Vector.from_coo(list(range(n_molecules)), [True] * n_molecules, size=n_molecules, dtype=bool)
    
    distance = 0
    found = False
    
    while frontier.nvals > 0 and not found:
        distance += 1
        result = frontier.vxm(A, gb.semiring.ss.min_secondi)
        next_frontier = Vector(bool, n_molecules)
        next_frontier << result
        mask = Vector(bool, n_molecules)
        mask << all_nodes
        mask(visited, gb.binary.second[bool]) << False
        next_frontier(mask) << next_frontier
        
        predecessors(next_frontier & (predecessors == -1)) << result
        
        if next_frontier[end_node].get(False):
            found = True
        frontier.clear()
        frontier << next_frontier
        visited |= next_frontier
```

### Key Differences in Shortest Path Computation
1. **Semiring Used**:
   - **Original**: `semiring.lor_land` (logical OR-AND) computes the next frontier by combining adjacency information with a boolean operation.
   - **Final**: `gb.semiring.ss.min_secondi` (SuiteSparse-specific min-second) uses a min operation on the second argument, optimized for BFS wavefront expansion in newer GraphBLAS versions.
   - **Impact**: `min_secondi` directly supports predecessor tracking in a single operation, while `lor_land` required additional steps.

2. **Predecessor Tracking**:
   - **Original**: 
     - Created an `A_indices` matrix with source indices as values.
     - Used `frontier_indices` (a vector of current frontier node indices) and a separate `parents` vector.
     - Computed parents via `frontier_indices.vxm(A_indices, semiring.min_first)`, then assigned to `predecessors`.
     - More complex, requiring two matrix operations per iteration.
   - **Final**: 
     - Uses the `result` from `vxm` directly to assign predecessors.
     - `predecessors(next_frontier & (predecessors == -1)) << result` leverages the indices from the wavefront expansion.
     - Simpler and more efficient, reducing to one matrix operation per iteration.
   - **Impact**: The final version eliminates the need for an extra index matrix and intermediate vector, improving performance and memory usage.

3. **Masking**:
   - **Original**: `mask(visited) << False` was correct but paired with `lor_land`, which didn’t fully align with modern GraphBLAS BFS idioms.
   - **Final**: `mask(visited, gb.binary.second[bool]) << False` uses an explicit binary operator, ensuring compatibility with `min_secondi` and GraphBLAS 2025.2.0.
   - **Impact**: The final masking is more robust and avoids type errors from earlier attempts with bitwise operators.

4. **Efficiency**:
   - **Original**: Extra matrix (`A_indices`) and vector operations increased computational overhead.
   - **Final**: Streamlined to a single `vxm` per iteration, leveraging `min_secondi`’s built-in predecessor support.
   - **Impact**: The final version is faster (e.g., 0.0050s for 5000 nodes vs. potentially slower in the original due to added steps).

5. **Path Correctness**:
   - Both versions correctly find shortest paths, but the final version’s simplicity reduces the risk of implementation errors and aligns with GraphBLAS’s optimized BFS patterns.

## Results (Final Version)

### Performance
- **200 molecules, 299 edges**: 15 hops, 0.0099s
- **100 molecules, 388 edges**: 4 hops, 0.0019s (visualized)
- **500 molecules, 1991 edges**: 4 hops, 0.0017s
- **1000 molecules, 5962 edges**: 4 hops, 0.0018s
- **5000 molecules, 24976 edges**: 7 hops, 0.0050s

### Sample Output (200 molecules)
```
GraphBLAS: Starting from 31, targeting 181
GraphBLAS: Found 181 at distance 15
GraphBLAS: Path: [31, 32, 33, 34, 61, 62, 63, 14, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181]
GraphBLAS: Took 0.0099s
Distance: 15 hops, Time: 0.0099s
```

### Why It’s Fast
- **Sparse Operations**: GraphBLAS uses compressed sparse formats.
- **Linear Algebra**: BFS via `vxm` is highly optimized.
- **Final Version**: Fewer operations per iteration than the original.

## Observations
- **Correctness**: Both versions find correct shortest paths, but the final version is more aligned with modern GraphBLAS.
- **Speed**: Final version’s streamlined approach contributes to sub-10ms times.
- **Mask Quirk**: Mask size reporting in debug output is a display issue, not functional.

## Potential Improvements
- **GPU Acceleration**: Enable GPU support for even faster execution.
- **Mask Optimization**: Investigate mask size reporting.
- **Bidirectional BFS**: Could reduce search depth.

## Usage
```bash
python script2.py
```
- Outputs BFS results for all test cases.
- Saves a PNG for the 100-molecule case.

## Acknowledgments
- Built with help from xAI’s Grok 3, debugging across multiple iterations.
- Tested on macOS with Anaconda environment `graphblas`.
